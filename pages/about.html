        I have always been fascinated with how and why people behave the way they do. 
        I have spent several years determining how listening to others can be helpful to their mental health. 
        Everyone has a story to tell and feeling listened to is a basic need at its core. 
        Through an internship focused on Forensic Psychology, youths in a detention center demonstrated 
        wanting to feel heard and not be judged for their actions. 
        Their pattern of habitual drug use helped determine the need for better mental health.

        A Forensic Psychology degree offered insight into the need for more non-judgmental and compassionate therapists. 
        An internship at the Phoenix House of the Mid-Atlantic provided for clients active listening and clarity. 
        These teenagers knew a group of counselors truly cared about their concerns and needs. 
        These adolescents received individual, group, and family therapy

        Though a majority of my clients from my internship were youths, I see clients from ages 13 - 18, adults, 
        and elderly individuals. I graduated from Marymount University with a Master of Arts degree in Counseling 
        followed by a residency where clients have shared their innermost issues and challenges.
